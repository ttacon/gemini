gemini
======

Eventually, gemini will be an orm for go which supports joins properly (as well as eager and lazy mode for them).

Also, gemini will support an in memory mode for testing your code such that it does not rely on the underlying database(s) that it uses.

Currently, development is ongoing and so no promises are made about stability.

Currently, I am not accepting any pull requests as I'm playing fast and loose with gemini.

A huge shout out needs to be made to cooper nurse (github.com/coopernurse/gorp). Gorp influenced/influences gemini in many ways, and I do think it was one of the first, extremely useful ORMs in go.
