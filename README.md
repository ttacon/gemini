gemini
======

Eventually, gemini will be an orm for go which supports joins properly (as well as eager and lazy mode for them).

Also, gemini will support an in memory mode for testing your code such that it does not rely on the underlying database(s) that it uses.

Currently, development is ongoing and so no promises are made about stability.
